Some Bonus Tips To Write A Good Bug Report
Given below are some additional tips on how to write a good Bug report:

**1) Report the problem immediately**

 If you find any bugs while testing, then you do not need to wait to write a detailed bug report later. Instead, write a bug report immediately. This will ensure a good and reproducible Bug report. If you decide to write the Bug report later on then there is a higher chance to miss the important steps in your report.

**2) Reproduce the bug three times before writing a Bug report**

Your bug should be reproducible. Make sure that your steps are robust enough to reproduce the bug without any ambiguity. If your bug is not reproducible every time, then you can still file a bug mentioning the periodic nature of the bug.

**3) Test the same bug occurrence on other similar modules**

Sometimes the developer uses the same code for different similar modules. So there is a higher chance for the bug in one module to occur in other similar modules as well. You can even try to find the more severe version of the bug you found.

**4) Write a good bug summary**

Bug summary will help the developers to quickly analyze the bug’s nature. A poor-quality report will unnecessarily increase development and testing time. Communicate well with your bug report summary. Keep in mind that the bug summary can be used as a reference to search for the bug in the bug inventory.

**5) Read the Bug report before hitting the Submit button**

Read all the sentences, wordings, and steps that are used in the bug report. See if any sentence is creating ambiguity that can lead to misinterpretation. Misleading words or sentences should be avoided in order to have a clear bug report.

**6) Do not use abusive language.**

It’s nice that you did good work and found a bug but do not use this credit for criticizing the developer or attacking any individual.
